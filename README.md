## Quick Start

```
git clone https://github.com/LachlanMurphy/Dijkstras-Visualization.git
cd Dijkstras-Visualization
cd src
make
./run
```

## Description

This is a program that uses OpenGL to visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm. The user can
create nodes and edges, modify edge's weights, and perform Dijkstra's Algorithm
on a starting and target node to find the shortest path. 

## How to Use

- To add a node press "+"
- To delete a node, click on it while pressing "backspace"
- To increase the weight of the most recently created edge press "p"
- To decrease the weight of the most recently created edge press "l"
- To select where Dijkstra's starting node is, click on a node while pressing "s"
- To select the target node for Dijkstra's Algorithm, click on a node while pressing "t"
- To perform Dijkstra's Algorithm, press "d"
